# 1. Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with Python code 

### Instruction 

##### Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
##### Agree ahead of time whether you’ll count off “rock, paper, scissors, shoot” or just “rock, paper, scissors.”
##### Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time.

###### This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. The game starts by asking the user for their name and then prompts them to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer then randomly selects its choice, and the game proceeds to determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

# 2. Lucky Card Dinner

##### This program is a fun and easy way to decide who will pay for a meal among a group of friends. Simply enter the names of the people in the group, run the program, and let it choose the lucky person who will cover the bill.

#####  This Python program generates a random name from a list of names entered by the user, using the "random" module. The user is prompted to enter names separated by commas, which are then stored in a list using the "split" method. The program then randomly selects a name from the list using the "randint" function and prints it as the person who will pay for the meal.

###### And it will also using the random.choice() fucntion to make simple but first use this function we need to understand the concepts so try without choice function
