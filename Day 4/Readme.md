# 1. Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with Python code 

### Instruction 

##### Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
##### Agree ahead of time whether you’ll count off “rock, paper, scissors, shoot” or just “rock, paper, scissors.”
##### Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time.

###### This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. The game starts by asking the user for their name and then prompts them to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer then randomly selects its choice, and the game proceeds to determine the winner based on the rules of the game.
